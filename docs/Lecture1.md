- An anomaly can be seen as data that deviates substantially from the norm 
- Anomaly detection is the process of identifying rare observations which differ substantially from the majority of the data from where they are drawn
- Applications include intrusion detection, fraud detection, fault detection, healthcare monitoring etc

### Example
- Assuming a single array/list of data contains a distribution of IQ scores within a given population
