- 異常可被視為與常態有顯著偏離的資料 An anomaly can be seen as data that deviates substantially from the norm 
- 異常偵測是一個識別罕見觀測值的過程，這些觀測值與其所屬的大多數資料有顯著差異 Anomaly detection is the process of identifying rare observations which differ substantially from the majority of the data from where they are drawn
- 應用範圍包括入侵偵測、詐欺偵測、故障偵測、醫療監控等 Applications include intrusion detection, fraud detection, fault detection, healthcare monitoring etc

### 範例 Example
- 假設單一陣列/列表中包含某一群體的智商分數分布 Assuming a single array/list of data contains a distribution of IQ scores within a given population
